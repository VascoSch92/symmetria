    r"""The ``Cycle`` class represents the cycle elements of a symmetric group.

    Recall that a cycle is a permutation that rearranges the elements of a finite set in a circular fashion, i.e.,
    moves each element to the position of the next element in a cycle manner, with the last element being moved to the
    position of the first element.

    To define a cycle, you need to provide its cycle notation.

    For example, to define the cycle :math:`\sigma \in S_3` given by :math:`\sigma(1)=3`, :math:`\sigma(2)=1` and
    :math:`\sigma(3)=2`, you should write ``Cycle(1, 3, 2)``

    .. note:: A cycle can have different representations. For example, the cycle ``Cycle(1, 3, 2)`` can be also
        written ``Cycle(2, 1, 3)``.

        By convention, a cycle start always with the smaller number. Don't panic, you can define a
        cycle in the way you like the most, but then it will be stored following the above convention.
